# FCCSharp
An attempt to recreate all of the freeCodeCamp Back End projects in .NET.

The freeCodeCamp Back End projects are as follows:
1. [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice)
2. [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)
3. [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
4. [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker)
5. [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

Because this project combines all microservices into one web app,
some URIs had to be changed to avoid collisions,
so the services will not work exactly as the freeCodeCamp automated grader expects.
